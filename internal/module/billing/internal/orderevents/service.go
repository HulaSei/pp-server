// Package orderevents runs billing's order-event outbox. An order state
// change commits its event row in the transaction that changes the order;
// this subdomain later broadcasts each committed event on its order's Redis
// channel, which wakes the order's event streams, and deletes the published
// events the replay contract no longer needs. Publishing is separate from
// writing the event on purpose: a Redis outage may delay a stream's wake-up
// but can never roll back a committed payment state. Only the module facade
// may reach it.
