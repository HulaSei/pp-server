// Package gateway is the billing module's single seam onto payment gateways.
// A Gateway speaks one gateway's protocol for one configured payment method:
// it starts a payment, reconciles a pending order before it closes, and
// authenticates and re-confirms the gateway's callbacks. Checkout, close and
// callback flows are written once against this interface; a Registry opens
// the gateway of a payment method from its typed configuration.
